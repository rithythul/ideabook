What made up the universe? 

For now, the bigbang is known as the beggining of our universe, agreed by many scientist. If it was true, what was before bigbang?

Let's assume that it was nothing. If it' was nothing, then we have got this whole univese from nothing. Let's talk talk about multiverse. 

If we assume that it was something before the bigbang, then what was it or where was it? We don't know. 

If that is so, lets us work with what we know and what we have. If what we have is nothing.
