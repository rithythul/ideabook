### Problem

Technology usage and internet users are growing rapidly across the globe, yet the buttom billions are still inaccessible. Even if they do have access to internet, they could only be a normal users, due to the tools they use are build for industries to take advantage of their attention economic both software and hardware. Thus, they cannot advance their learning and become a valuable contributor to the technology revolution of our age. 

There are more than 3 billions people throughout the world need to access to the internet in the next decade to come. We must provide them the right tools to use and environment to learn to prepare themselves. 

### Solution

We are building a line of tools bases on open source and free software principle for both software application and hardware device. The tools we hope will help our generation and the next to speed up their work and learning. So they can help shape our evolution a whole forward in the positive direction.

One of the first solutions we offered was an affordable notebook computer. Pre-installed with our own customed made Linux-based Operating System and shipped with all open source applications as an alternative to proprietary software, yet stay compatible. Through that first offers several mores come into puzzled.

### Timing --> Why now?
Internet has leveling the global playing field through information. Though so far, only those who have access to computer could take advantage of the internet and joined the club. This was only possible for develop nations or community, in the last 20-30 years. 

Smartphone is great at delivering information to far distant, but hard for potential engineers and innovators to take information they recieved make sense of it, recreate and innovate further. Both of internet infrastructure are powered by Open Source and Linux. 

On the other hand, notebook computer has become much more affordable thanks to the abundance of hardwares

### Traction
We launched to public on October 2018, since then we have sold around 1300 KOOMPI and lease 280 KOOMPI to school partners for education purposes. 

### Target Market
Our primary users are youth in school, mostly secondary and high schools students. Though, since it's so good, many other users who want to save cost on hardware and want to experiment with open source could still use it as well. In fact, since our launch, more than 50% of our users are general public. 

### Market size
There are more than 1.57 billion students globally, according to data from UNESCO. While Cambodia has more than 3 millions students are in K-12. Most of them will need a notebook computer to learn, even they might already have smartphone, we believe. Especially, if they learn computer related subjects such as computer programming.

Since the world is changing to digital, there will be a growing need of jobs in the computer programming and computer related skills, much more than an office applications and normal office jobs.

### Current Focus Market
Our current market is Cambodia, while we test our notebook device and some application. We are also open to test market outside of Cambodia that has similarity to Cambodia market such as South East Asia, South Asia, Africa. 

### Cometitors 
Our competitors are devices makers such as Acer, Asus and other device maker which base on lacacy Microsoft OS. On top of that, there are also several others open source base notebook providers globally. 

We consider them as part of the force to empowered the next generation of innovators. So in away, we are collaborative for commond goal. Plush the market is so huge, so there are a lot of room for everyone to play.

### Competitive Advantages
Almost all of our competitors are either only make the hardware or only make the operating system. We do both, which make it easier to make both hardware and software compatible as well as keep the price low. 

Plus, we don't just provide devices, we are also provide educators to get users onboard. Especially, users in the educational institutions. We also providing other learning tools and open our OS to developers to build applications to reach their users via our community and vise versa.
