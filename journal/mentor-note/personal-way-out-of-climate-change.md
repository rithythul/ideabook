When it comes to climate change and global warming, I believe the argument is used as a political tool for division and control, and that concern for the environment is a voluntary and individual choice, and that personal actions taken should be directed reflected in lifestyle choices.

1. discourage child birth for all young people, except the most qualified and ecologically sensitive.

2. avoid private and public transportation whenever possible, live without using an automobile, or any transportation that burns fossil fuels, always walk or ride your bicycle everywhere.

3. own only one change of clothes and pair of shoes, wear them to their limits, hand wash your clothes in cold water, take short cold showers, and use less water altogether.

4. always prepare your own meals, cook fewer meals, eat simple basic foods, more uncooked raw foods, and be vegan or vegetarian.

5. spend a minimal amount of money on everything, always avoid buying new, always buy second-hand, consume less, reduce, reuse, and recycle absolutely everything. 

6. Be a dumpster diver and trash picker, locate and sort through public discards to find useful materials, to use for yourself or share with others, embrace strategic homelessness as a way of life.

7. Design your life where you are able to carry everything you own on your bicycle, including a small solar panel to produce your own electricity, and make your bicycle the center point of your lifestyle choices.

8. encourage everyone you know to do the same, but don't judge or condemn them if they are unable to comply.
