# Role of Startup Founders & CEO

As a founder or a leader of a company or organization, especially the startup organization, one must be sharp and adaptive. 

In addition, one must be able to:

1. formulate a vision and strategic plan for the company, and then effectively communicate this throughout the organization;
2. gather, nurture and motivate great team leaders and players;
3. ensure the company executes decisions as planned, while building monthly cash flows.

# Creating & Defining Vision and Strategy

A vision is the "north star" of the company, which leaders and team players use as a directional guide for important decision making, and to maintain a steady course of action. A great vision is always enthusiastically shared among the whole organization.

The startup organizational team is as a train of railroad cars, moving steadily along the track. 

The journey is long and steady, while along the way, there are those who will want the train to slow down, so they can get off, to navigate their own personal course of action. 

The process of saying goodbye can be painful, but often necessary if the leader is to keep the organizational train traveling on course and moving at proper speed.

Overall group motivation is critical for team formation, while each individual member may be motivated in a different way.  To provide effective group motivation, team leaders must understand and respond to individual needs in a timely way.

With each individual recognized, all team members work closely together to motivate each other toward a unified vision and plan.

The great team must possess a culture that nurtures and cultivates new and fresh ideas. Its members must seek out truth and transparency in decision making, in order to foresee and avoid errors of judgement.

It continues, but I don't understand this:

Thus, executing the plan should orientated, not people or how much tasks we completed.
