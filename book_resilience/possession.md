## Possession less, be productive and be happy

Life is more free, when we have less personal material possession, but how could we have less of those? 

Lot of time, we think in order to live well, we need to have these things or that things. Otherwise, life isn't complete. When, we have that things and these things we see other things. Where is the final stage? 

If we keep living this way, we won't be ever enough. 

Life should be live with higher purpose. Finding happiness and contentment beside the very personal gain.

It's meant that we should go and become a monk. We can still work, make money to do more work. Not making money for the sake of making money.
