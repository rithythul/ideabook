# Resilience

This book is a reflection of my life, my thought process, what I see, think, and how I work and live. The lesson I have learn in the last 15 years from the day I left home and seek for high education, purpose, and new standard of living. 

The book will be structured into 7 main chapters, inspired by Chakra's system, a symtem to understand ones's soul anatomomy, from root to crown. Discovering Chakra is when I was struggling to get back to being from strong stomache acid disease started in mid-2016. Understanding and believe in Chakra led me to study more about myself and my body's need. Thus, this book is part of Chakra and part of my life lesson. 

I am not look to inspire to change anyone's life, but in part of sharing knowledge and keep record of our human knowledge. As we know that human is the only animale we know that transfering knowledge not only limited to genetic mutantion but also through writing and communication. History teaches us many things in the past, assumming history is fair and not bias, which I will touch base on this in the book in details.  

Note: from root to crown
1. I Am
2. I Feel
3. I Do
4. I Love
5. I Talk
6. I See
7. I Understand (part of understand and think)
