Last few week has been a little strange. Many people around seem to feel unwell and not so productive, including myself. So I took this time off productive mode to think and find root cause. 

In the process, I stumble upone many topics that somehow even more distructed me from my current work. I decided to write it all down to get it out of the way, so I can get back to work with **FOCUS**. 

I have a love hate relationship with **technology**. Looking back we have done great as humanity progress. Looking forward seem very exciting, yet very scary. With technolgy and the power of internet human could, before we realized, play god. 

The part that we can play god scary me as well as excit me. So I decided to digg more of what I love to work on in the next 10-20 years. At least be part of those who do the work in those field, help them, guide them, and promote them. Since Avocading technologies seem to be part of my natural born telents.

Below are my selected technologies and problem I want to solve or want to be solved. Plus, some problems/topics to be considered solving and promoting. 

These seem to be too much. I am not sure, if I will still have the interest 5-10 years down the road. For now, here they are all my selected ones;

## Technologies we will use from now till the next tech breakthrough
Based on the principle of **the lightbuld was not created by incrementally improving the candle.**

- Blockchain (DAGs) and Cryptocurrencies
-  Artificial Intelligence, IoT & Robotic  
- Energy Storage & Transfer 
- 3D printing
- Augmented & Virtual Reality
- Nanotechnology
- Biotechnology

## Problems we love to focus

- Education for 21st Century (Education for Everyone)
- Internet for Everyone (decentralized autonomus and anonymous) 
- Private Data & Home Security

- Autonomous Vehicles and smart transportation

- CO2 Extracting from Air
- Clean water from Air
- Viable Plastic replacement

- Food Alternative Superfood (Nutrition from bugs)
- Longevity Project

## Topic to consider 
- Space exploration and resources capture (asteroid mining industry is around $100 trillion) 
- Future of Workd & (maybe Universal Basic Income)
- Male birth-control
- Obeasity treatment without side affect
- Bio-printing & organ printing

I will write about each one of them later when I have the time. Each single problem could have a very significant for life on earth. In return, those who solve these problem could reward with a lot of perks, could be social status and billions of dollars.
