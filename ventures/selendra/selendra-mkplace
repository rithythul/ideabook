5. Describe how you are using the above technology; (150 words max)

Build a Dapp Marketplace that provide a virtual market, so they can trade from their home.
All transactions and payment settlement are done in the Dapp.  


6. Describe the results of your initial prototyping:
From then initial prototype we intend to provide service to one villages with around 80-100 families. 
Their current main income generation is from logging trees to make chacoal. If we could change their 
income generation activity to growing plants, fruits and veggies and animal raising and connect them
to the bigger market in the city, while at the sametime keep it open and flexible to service local 
market where they live, if there are needs.

This kind of village situation are everywhere in Cambodia and other developing country. 
We would like to service these families first, before we could scale to other villages nationwide.
