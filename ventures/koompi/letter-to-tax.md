# Global Opportunities, yet to start locally

_Since the advance of the internet and smartphone, the number of PC shipped has been a narrow grow. Nevertheless, it's still shipped a fairly good amount and it will contrinue to need because smartphone apps and other platform need notebooks or tablet PCs to build their apps. Especially, the device that run users friendly linux-base operating system_ 

The current total world population are roughly 7.8 billions people. The current average population increase is estimated at 81 million people per year, according to [Worldometers Population](https://www.worldometers.info/watch/world-population/). This meant that by 2030, we will have a total of 8.6 billion people. That is a lot of people.

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263393/global-pc-shipments-since-1st-quarter-2009-by-vendor/), since 2009 to Q1 of 2020, the worldwide nubmer of PC/Notebook combined are roughly around 3,450 billion units with average of around 300 million units per year. Consider the life spans of machine to last about 5 years. As of now, we would have around 60% or 2.4 billion of those machines are in used. 

If 2/3 people in the world will need a notebook/tablet PCs to study or work, we would still need around 3.27 billion more machine. These people are mostly in developing nations. Therefore, they wouldn't be able to buy a Mac or Windows that cost more than USD 1,000. Also, most of them are in primary or secondary school now, so the would need to use at least two notebooks each, one lower cost at around USD 150 and one for when they are at university or at work at the cost of around USD 510 - USD1,000. We should get the picture of how this could happen here.

With more people coming online, thank to the help smartphone and PCs/Notebooks. More people will need machine that more than just for social apps such as Facebook and TikTok. 

They will need for learning and especially programming and other creative and productive work, than just socializing. Obviously, people will do a lot of socializing, but we want to be with the creators more than the users of the platform.

On the other hand, the operating system that make the devices work are as equally important. Curretnly, Microsoft Windows account for 78% of the desktop market share, Mac OS took 14%, a ChromeOS which is a linux-base OS 2%, and other Linux account for 2.8%. At the moment Linux only popular only amoung programmers and advance users, according to [Fortunly](https://fortunly.com/blog/lap-top-market-share/#gref) report in late 2019.

Since the Linux based OS is still owning a small market share, we see there a big room of growth ahead. Once, we made it popular among nomal users with a more user-friendly OS tailor to new users that shipped with a hardware that come with it.

Without talking about any other indirect outcome
