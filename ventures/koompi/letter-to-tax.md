# About KOOMPI

KOOMPI is a technology development company based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia that designs and builds solutions-oriented productivity tools for next-generation doers and innovators.

_Our Mission is to build tools for and provide resources for the next generation of innovators._

_Our Vision is to unlock our fellow human beingâ€™s unlimited capacity for self-directed learning by encouraging curiosity, flexibility, and creative imagination._

# Principles
- __Do the hard things__: we don't do it because it's easy. We do it because it's hard.
- __Embrace Do It Yourself__ (DIY): 
- __Be organized__: most engineers accept that an engineer's table must be messy. We say it must be organized as well as everything else. 
- __Stay focused__:
- __Stay the course__:
- __Attention to details__:
- __Endure the Impossible mission__: To make the impossible possible. 

# Global opportunities, yet to start locally

_Since the advance of the internet and smartphone, the number of PCs shipped has seen little growth. Nevertheless, a faily good amount has been and will continue to be shipped. This is because smartphone apps and other platforms are built using notebooks or tablet PCs, especially, the devices that run user-friendly linux-based operating system._ 

The current total world population is roughly 7.8 billion people. The current average population increase is estimated at
 81 million people per year, according to [Worldometers Population](https://www.worldometers.info/watch/world-population/). This means that by 2030, we will have a total of 8.6 billion people. 

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263393/global-pc-shipments-since-1st-quarter-2009-by-vendor/), since 2009 to Q1 of 2020, the worldwide number of PCs/Notebooks combined is roughly around 3,450 billion units with an average of around 300 million units per year. Considering the life span of machines is about 5 years, we would now have around 60% or 2.4 billion of those machines in use. 

If 2/3 people in the world need a notebook/tablet PCs to study or work, we would still need around 3.27 billion more machines. Most people in developing nations wouldn't be able to buy a Macbooks or Windows that cost more than USD 1,000 each. Most of them are also in primary or secondary school now, so each person would need to use at least two notebooks, one that costs as little as around USD 150 and one for when they are at university or at work at the cost of around USD 510 - USD1,000. This is a rough picture of how this will work. 

With more people going online due to accessable smartphones and PCs/notebooks, more people will need machines that runs more than just social apps such as Facebook and TikTok. 

They will need tools for more than just socializing: learning, programming, and other creative and productive work. Obviously, people will still have social interaction, but we also want to see creators more than just users of existing platforms.

On the other hand, the operating system that makes the devices work is equally important. Currently, Microsoft Windows accounts for 78% of the desktop market share, Mac OS took 14%, ChromeOS (a linux-based OS) 2%, and other Linux distributions account for 2.8%. At the moment, Linux is exclusively popular amoung programmers and advance users, according to [Fortunly](https://fortunly.com/blog/lap-top-market-share/#gref) report in late 2019.

Since Linux-based OS(s) are still owning a small percentage of the market share, there is still more than enough room for future growth. Once, we made it popular among regular computer users by tailoring a user-friendly OS that comes to life in its very own hardware.

Without talking about any other indirect outcome (need text here)

# What we do

## Software & Platform

- KOOMPI OS, a multipurpose operating system based on linux kernel that aims to bring the best of open source to the next 3 billion people that will go online in the next decade. 

- KOOMPI Academy, a self-directed learning platform that empowers people to learn and teach remotely.

- KOOMPI Wifi, a local wifi mesh network that provides internet access to schools, partners, and villages nearby with local cache.

- KOOMPI Play, an education and stretegic game platform that includes the collection of digital assets that connect to real world assets, powered by Blockchain.

- KOOMPI BI, a minimal business intellegence that empowers small businesses to operate in the digital era, built to run KOOMPI Co,.ltd.

- KOOMPI Decentralized Storage, a peer-to-peer storage and computational service powered by devices that run KOOMPI OS with Selendra Blockchain node enabled.

- KOOMPI Singularity, an OS the works simultanously in all devices using microkernel system.

## Initiative
- __One Notebook One Student__: Learning computing requires plenty of effort and time. We hope to initiate this OSON program by cooperating with partners to make dreams becomes reality. Children from all corner of the planet will be able to use ingenuity in solving potential problems in the future.

- __One School One Lab__: We believe Linux, of any kind, would empower many students to be curious and begin self-directed learning. For example, everyone at KOOMPI are continuously self-studying with some guidance from their peers, mentor, and the internet.

- __Internet for Everyone__: KOOMPI wifi will be used in peer-to-peer achitecture to allow local internet and cache, make the internet low-cost and more accessible to remote villages. This project will bring more people online with better, more decentralized, and democratized Internet connection. 

# Jobs

## Community Jobs
In One School One Lab, every deployed KOOMPI-OS basesd Linux Lab, we will have one KOOMPI educator standby at the partnered school, financially covered by KOOMPI, volunteers, sponsors, or charity. The goal is to transfer knowledge to local teachers and students for the schools. This will create at least 4,000 jobs in the next 5 to 7 years. 

## Engineering & High Tech Skills
Consideirng the high demand, we project to have a local assembling house in Phnom Penh before 2025. We will start making our own PCBA and other single board computers for other learning and small innovation purposes.

We also plan to make our own RISC-V base CPU to prepare for KOOMPI Singularity OS. And the world goes on!
