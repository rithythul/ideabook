According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263393/global-pc-shipments-since-1st-quarter-2009-by-vendor/), since 2009 to Q1 of 2020, the worldwide nubmer of PC/Notebook combined are roughly around 3,450 billion units with average of around 300 million units per year. 

Consider the life spans of machine to 5 years long. This meant PCs/Notebook that are in used account to around 70% of the total ship of the whole decade to be generous.

The current total world population are roughly 7.8 billions people. The current average population increase is estimated at 81 million people per year, according to [Worldometers Population](https://www.worldometers.info/watch/world-population/). This meant that by 2030, we will have a total of 8.6 billion people. That is a lot of people.
