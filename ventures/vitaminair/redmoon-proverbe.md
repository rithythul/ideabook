# VA Red Moon

Some words to remind us why we are here at VitaminAir.

We are here to create a sustainable living village,
where people practice active and healthy living diet.
On top of that, found their reason of being. 

Turn village of Red Moon village into an educated 
and nature friendly community. Villagers value each 
other and look out for one another. 

Become the potential Blue Zone where people live
healthy, happy, and long life. Inspired by the island 
of Okinawa, a village of longlife.
