#WELCOME 
Welcome to VitaminAir! We hope you have a good time being here.

Though, VitaminAir is neither a resort, nor a hotel. It's still 
very primitive in many way. We now have a house and a few platform
to put up tents to sleep at night. 

Since this is not mean as the resort or hotel, please don't expect
food to be served and bed to be prepared. Everyone is expected to help 
contribute and clean after yourself. 

First, when you arrived you will find yourself a place to sleep,
which meant set up tents or do any other thing to survive. You are 
free to explore the area, hike up the hill, walk-in-to-the-wood; at
your own risk. But, please lets us know where you go.

We have limited first-aid kits, so be causes of the ground and things
around. It's not dangerous, but it's jungle so best we want is people 
don't get themselves hurt.

#ABOUT_VA

Our goal is to set up a pilot project to reforest the land up-to
at least 70% of the total land we own. The left over would put into
use in natural farming, eco-tourism, and other income generation
activities to support community development and the reforestation itself. 
 
When successful emplimented, VitaminAir will serve as an inspiration
for other projects to give nature the first priority in their planning.

Apart from reforestation, we hope to participate in C02 trading, thus
it will give communities the incentive to protect and grow more trees
as opposed to cut tree for their livelihood. This is part of the 
incentivization for behavior changes.

Will use three main technology to facilitate this process;
- Drone Seeds Bomb and Forest Survelliance 
- AirToWater 
- Natural Resources Tokenization based on Blockchain

We are what we eat & what we think as well as what we breath.

#ACCOMODATION
Sleep in Tent: we have tents that fit around 10-15 people.
Sleep in House: our house can fit up-to 8 people.

The house is a bit noisy though, because we build it on steal
with speed. The main purpose of the house is to store things
away from rain -- while also able to sleep.
