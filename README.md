# About 

This repo contains some of the project readme that I am working on, ideas and conceptual notes, stories I am writting on the go, and some vision that comes to mind.

# Timetable

At present, I am dedicated 7 hours aday to do these specific tasks. 

3 hours of a day for business development. Two hours for [KOOMPI](https://koompi.com) and 1 hour for [SmallWorld Venture](https://smallworldventure.com). 

3 hours for coding related, mainly for `Rust` and OS/Scripting. 

2 hours for work and guests meeting.  

1 hour a day reading; research papers and books.

The rest is for eat, sleep, personal time. 

Let's see how effective I could be in the next 6 months or so.
