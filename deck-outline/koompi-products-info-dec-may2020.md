### About KOOMPI

KOOMPI is a technology development company based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia that designs and builds solutions-oriented productivity tools for next-generation doers and innovators.

We want to contribute to technology's role in serving to make the world a better place for everyone.

Digital networking technology is the glue that holds us all together, and without it, our modern world would not function, setting us all back two centuries.

We believe it is our priviledge to provide the best tools for our environment, so our youth can learn and grow to create an even better world for the next generation.

Our learning and productivity tools are value-added products, built upon the acclaimed Linux operating system, and include a wide variety of custom applications tailored to meet the needs of students, business managers, and employees.

KOOMPI is focused on empowering our youth and workforce both locally and globally, in developed and undeveloped nations, through the design, development, implementation, provision and support of our full line of low-cost, full-power, off-grid open-source notebook and netbook solutions.

For an active, on-the-go workstation, where the power of the sun alone can keep all your devices powered up and ready for action, our notebooks are designed to meet the needs of both new learners and power users, whether at home, in the office, or off-grid out in the field.

Our line of thin, sleek, and elegant notebooks, designed and assembled in Cambodia, provide a compact self-contained work and learning environment.

Whether learning alone at home, or networked within a virtual classroom, our line of products provide enough power and flexibility for the professional.

In an age of social distancing, work and learn at home students and employees, we see homebound education and work opportunities becoming the world's fastest growing service industry.

KOOMPI works to fill the needs of people now required to remain at home, whose lives in the classroom and at the office had been transformed overnight.

Technology empowers the individual, and the digital divide is the great divide between the aspiring children of the world who have internet technology, and those who do not.

Our value-added productivity tools serve to bridge across this digital divide, which denies opportunity and has social costs.

Even as satellite signals beam down internet freely, many young, bright, and deserving children remain without access to modern learning tools.

With widepread internet and mesh networks, our products offer the knowledge and wonder of vast libraries to even the hardest to reach regions of the world.

With the advent of dispersed work and learning, access to information means any bright young person, however remote, can grow, learn, and work among technology professionals, securing employment and wages through the digital economy.

We provide the hardware, software, personal advice and service needed for off-site learning and productivity issues related to both classroom and office.

### KOOMPI Initiatives

At the moment we only pilot in Cambodia. 

KOOMPI One-School-One-Lab
We want to see every school install a Linux Lab. We believe Linux, of any kind, would empowered many students to be curious and begin self-directed learning. As an example, everyone at KOOMPI are self-tought with some guiden from peers.  

KOOMPI One-Student-One-Notebook (OSON)
A mission to provide student a device of their own, since learning computer require investing time with computer. OSON hope to work with partners to make this dream a reality, so children from all corner of the planet could share their enginoity to help us solve the unknown problem to come.


### Timing --> Why now?
Internet has leveling the global playing field through information. Though so far, only those who have access to computer could take advantage of the internet and joined the club. This was only possible for develop nations or community, in the last 20-30 years.

Smartphone is great at delivering information to far distant, but hard for potential engineers and innovators to take information they recieved make sense of it, recreate and innovate further. Both of internet infrastructure are powered by Open Source and Linux.

On the other hand, notebook computer has become much more affordable thanks to the abundance of hardwares

### Traction
We launched to public on October 2018, since then we have sold around 1300 KOOMPI and lease 280 KOOMPI to school partners for education purposes.

### Target Market
Our primary users are youth in school, mostly secondary and high schools students. Though, since it's so good, many other users who want to save cost on hardware and want to experiment with open source could still use it as well. In fact, since our launch, more than 50% of our users are general public.

### Market size
There are more than 1.57 billion students globally, according to data from UNESCO. While Cambodia has more than 3 millions students are in K-12. Most of them will need a notebook computer to learn, even they might already have smartphone, we believe. Especially, if they learn computer related subjects such as computer programming.

Since the world is changing to digital, there will be a growing need of jobs in the computer programming and computer related skills, much more than an office applications and normal office jobs.

### Current Focus Market
Our current market is Cambodia, while we test our notebook device and some application. We are also open to test market outside of Cambodia that has similarity to Cambodia market such as South East Asia, South Asia, Africa.

### Cometitors
Our competitors are devices makers such as Acer, Asus and other device maker which base on lacacy Microsoft OS. On top of that, there are also several others open source base notebook providers globally.

We consider them as part of the force to empowered the next generation of innovators. So in away, we are collaborative for commond goal. Plush the market is so huge, so there are a lot of room for everyone to play.

### Competitive Advantages
Almost all of our competitors are either only make the hardware or only make the operating system. We do both, which make it easier to make both hardware and software compatible as well as keep the price low.

Plus, we don't just provide devices, we are also provide educators to get users onboard. Especially, users in the educational institutions. We also providing other learning tools and open our OS to developers to build applications to reach their users via our community and vise versa.
